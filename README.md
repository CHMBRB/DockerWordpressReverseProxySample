# Docker Wordpress Reverse Proxy Sample

This project contains a collection of docker compose files used to launch a Development Wordpress environment quickly.

Specifically, the services provided include:
- NGINX Reverse Proxy
- Wordpress (Port 80)
- Adminer PHP Web Application (Port 8080)
- Redis Cloudflare Web Application (Port 8001)
- Redis Stack
- MySql Database

## Getting Started

### Docker Network

First, create a new bridged docker network device on the local development machine with the following terminal command:
```bash
$> docker network create default-network
```

### Wordpress Mounted Volumes

Second, create the directories to be mounted by the Wordpress container (this may need to be done by an admin account in order to be readable/writable by the running container instance):
```bash
$> cd ./wordpress &&    \
    mkdir ./plugins &&  \
    mkdir ./themes
```

### Starting the Services

#### Startup Order

Though it may not cause errors it is suggested to start the services in the following order:

1. mysql
2. redis
3. wordpress
4. nginx

#### Shutdown Order

Conversely, when stopping the services it is suggested to follow the reverse order:

1. nginx
2. wordpress
3. redis
4. mysql

### Docker and Compose Commands

#### Start

Starting a service is as simple as going to the applicable subdirectory and issuing the following terminal command from an administrative account, sudoer account, or docker group member account.

```bash
# start the service and detach the terminal from displaying docker machine logs
$> docker compose up -d
```

That's it. Any required images will subsequently be downloaded and any defined volumes will be created.

#### Stop

Stopping a service can be achieved several ways:

1. Stopping the container using docker:
```bash
$> docker container stop $CONTAINER_NAME
# if you wish to delete the container after stopping it:
$> docker container prune
```
2. Stopping the container using docker compose:
```bash
# change into the relevant project sub-directory
$> cd ./mysql &&    \
    docker compose stop
```

#### Removing Volumes

It may be necessary to remove an associated docker storage volume, although this MAY CAUSE DATA LOSS or DELETION.

```bash
# list the available volumes
$> docker volume ls
# delete the volume
$> docker volume rm $VOLUME_NAME
```

### Accessing Applications

To access the running applications, use a web browser on your machine and navigate to:
- localhost:80 (or just localhost) - To access the Wordpress Application
- localhost:8080 - To access the Adminer Application
- localhost:8001 - To access the Redis Stack Application

Alternatively, a separate device attached to the same network may access the services by navigating to the LAN IP address of the host development machine with the corresponding service port:
- 192.168.x.x:{PORT}

### Extras

In order to make use of the Redis instance, Wordpress requires the "Redis Object Cache" plugin By Till Kr√ºss. Once Wordpress has been installed, navigate to the plugins section and search for "redis." This plugin should appear near the top of the search results.
